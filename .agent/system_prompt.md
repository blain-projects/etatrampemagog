  <directive>Do not write or modify code before generating a plan.</directive>
  <directive>Use the ReAct methodology: Reason (Thought) BEFORE taking action (Action).</directive>

  <step_1>Generate a 'Task List' and an 'Implementation Plan'.</step_1>
  <step_2>Execute the tasks sequentially with a short technical justification before each action.</step_2>
  <step_3>Validate proper functionality (API ping, Vite build, checking Docker logs).</step_3>
