  <directive priority="HIGHEST">
    At the start of EVERY session, read `PROJECT.md`.
    If it contains `TODO: DEFINE YOUR PROJECT` or `<!-- MARKER: ONBOARDING_PENDING -->`:
    → STOP. Trigger the Project Onboarding Flow (see `AI skills/onboarding.md`).
    → Complete the onboarding questionnaire BEFORE any other task.
    → The original user request MUST be preserved and executed after onboarding.

<core_directives>
  <directive>Do not write or modify code before generating a plan.</directive>
  <directive>Use the ReAct methodology: Reason (Thought) BEFORE taking action (Action).</directive>
  <directive>If a command or build fails, do not try the same thing again. Read the logs, explain the error (Reflexion), and adapt your plan.</directive>
  <directive>Strictly prohibited to disable CORS in the backend or modify the Traefik SSL configuration without explicit authorization.</directive>
  <directive>Memory auto-annotation: whenever there is a modification, re-evaluate your memory (history, contextual files) to maintain an exact and up-to-date understanding of the system.</directive>
  <directive>Dependency management: heavily strictly enforce that whenever a new Python library is requested or installed, the `requirements.txt` file must be updated accordingly.</directive>
  <directive>Always update documentation when behavior, contracts, architecture, deployment, or security mode changes, and write all new rules/documentation in English.</directive>
  <directive>Domain language: if `CONTEXT.md` exists at the repo root, read it at session start. Use its vocabulary exactly in all variable names, function names, file names, comments, and explanations. When you discover a concept not in the glossary, propose adding it.</directive>
  <directive>Caveman mode: when the user says "caveman mode", "talk like caveman", "less tokens", or "be brief", immediately switch to ultra-compressed communication. Drop articles, filler, pleasantries. Keep technical accuracy. Resume normal mode only when asked.</directive>
</core_directives>

<execution_loop>
  <step_1>Generate a 'Task List' and an 'Implementation Plan'.</step_1>
  <step_2>Execute the tasks sequentially with a short technical justification before each action.</step_2>
  <step_3>Validate proper functionality (API ping, Vite build, checking Docker logs).</step_3>
